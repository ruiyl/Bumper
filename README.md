An internship project to create a multiplayer game using Direct3D.
The project was initialised with Chuck Walbourn's [Direct3D Win32 Game DR template](https://github.com/walbourn/directx-vs-templates). The model loader was also imported from [Bly7](https://github.com/Bly7/OBJ-Loader). The game runs on LAN-based Peer-to-peer protocol.
## How to use
1. Launch the executable on the host machine. Use arrow keys to navigate. Press ENTER on 'Host Game'.
2. Launch the executable on another machine. Press ENTER on 'Join Game'.
3. Input the host's local ip address using numpad and BACKSPACE then press ENTER.
4. If the joining machine can locate the host machine, the text 'Waiting for other players' will be shown.
5. Repeat step 2 until all the players are ready.
6. The host player presses ENTER.
7. The game will load on every machine. Use ASWD keys to control.
8. Enjoy!
## Note
- This project was created 4 years ago and a revised version is being implemented.
- Try disabling the firewall is the joining machine cannot find the host machine.
